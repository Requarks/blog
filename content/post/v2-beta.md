The very first beta of Wiki.js v2.0 is finally here!

## But first...

THIS IS A **BETA** RELEASE. It is not production-ready and is missing many critical features! It might crash and you might loose data. This is stricly for testing and development purposes.

That being said, you'll be able to easily upgrade between beta releases, up to the final release.

## What's New in 2.0?

This new version is a complete rewrite from the ground up. It's fully modular, more powerful and customizable than ever.

One of the biggest lesson learned from v1 was how users want to customize their wiki to make it their own. Not only from a visual perspective, but from the technical side as well. The git requirement was cumbersome for many users. Some found the Markdown editor confusing. The search engine didn't work in non-latin languages. The permission system was severily limited.

This all changes with 2.0.
